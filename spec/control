 application security. Effectively, it is an intrusion detection and prevention
 system for the web server. 
 .
 At the moment its main features are:
   * Audit log; store full request details in a separate file, including POST 
     payloads.
   * Request filtering; incoming requests can be analysed and offensive requests
     can be rejected (or simply logged, if that is what you want). This feature 
     can be used to prevent many types of attacks (e.g. XSS attacks, SQL 
     injection, ...) and even allow you to run insecure applications on your 
     servers (if you have no other choice, of course).
